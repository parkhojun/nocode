# No Code - Ainize

No code is the best way to write secure and reliable applications. Write nothing; deploy nowhere. But I deployed it.

### Deploying

I deployed it [here](https://ainize.ai/deployment/gkswjdzz/nocode). I wrote three lines of code of 
Dockerfile.

It is very insecure and non-reliable.

## Contributing

Can you reduce the code?
